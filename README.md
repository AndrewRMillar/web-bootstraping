# Web project bootstrapping repo
This repo is specificaly meant as a bare bones starting point for new projects. As it stands it is mainly a JavaScript starter, will maybe do a php one also. Will be adding parts when and if I come across new features I would like to add 

## Gulp
To use the Gulp version run the following commands in the terminal, after cloning the repo:
```sh
npm install
gulp
```
You can run `gulp watch` when you want to use live reload functionality.
